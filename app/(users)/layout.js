//! 1.App Router - In Next.js(after v13+) for routing we use app router where inside App folder structure, folder create and their page.jsx ui define and Root layout.js(where all page.jsx render pass then show in Ui)

//! 2.Route Group- (it's not affect the final URL path)
//? In Next.js App Router, Router Groups are way to organize our routes without affecting the URL structure.
//? This helps separate pages logically (like admin, user, auth) without showing these groups in the final route path.
//^ Usecase - Defining multiple root layouts.

//* e.g -  users folder ko rename karege (Route Group) banane k liye : (users)

// In short Route groups ek aisa folder hota hain jinka naam bracket m diya jata hai , ye folder url path m appear nhi hota hai , but here only users folder ko bracket m close kiya hai admin ko nhi isliye usse access karne k liye url path m admin likhna padega , and dono k root layout bhi different hai

//! 3.Global Css vs Css Module

//! 4.Image Component with diff. property & SEO benefits

//! 5.Font Optimization - next/font used
//# next/font automatically optimize font , it's built in self-hosting for any font file, so we can optimally load web fonts(no required to  send request for third party font)

//# import it from next/font/local or next/font/google

//? What is Subset in next/font ?
//# A subset in fonts refers to a specific "group of characters(glyphs)" based on a language or script.
//* e.g-
//$ Latin - includes basic "English and Western European characters".
//$ Cyrillic - includes characters for Russian, Bulgarian, etc.
//$ Arabic -includes Arabic script.
//$ Greek, Hebrew, etc.
//^ Advantage -  Instead of downloading all possible characters in every script, we specify the subsets we need, this:
// Reduces the font file size
// Improves performance and loading times
// Makes the font more focused on our audience's language

//? Why Weight Property is Not Required in next/font when used variable font ?
// when we use variable font , weight (default-400), style also automatically add. (e.g- "Roboto_Flex" )
// Next.js recommended using variable fonts for the best performance and flexibility.
// But if we not use variable font, we will need to specify a weight, style. (e.g- "Roboto","Word Sans" )

//! 6.Add Metadata, Fav Icon, OG Tags, Twitter cards (It helps for SEO and Web shareability(show image card in social media when share website link) ) -
//# two default meta tag are always add if route doesn't define metadata (meta charset tag , meta viewport tag) .
//# Metadata object we add all data (meta data , fav icon, Og (open Graph) tag, Twitter tag) , this object we can define in Root Layout, any individual Page or layout .

//! 7. React Server Component(backend part here)  v/s Client Component (React-Frontend part here)
//# By default Inside App folder all files is server component , except one file that is error.js

//* when use Client Components when you need:
//  State and event handlers. E.g. onClick, onChange.
//  Lifecycle logic. E.g. useEffect.
//  Browser-only APIs. E.g. localStorage, window, Navigator.geolocation, etc.
//  Custom hooks.

//* Use Server Components when you need:
// Fetch data from databases or APIs close to the source.
// Use API keys, tokens, and other secrets without exposing them to the client. (means browser pr client side network tab m api key or other variable show nhi hote hai kuyki wo directly server per phle render hoke then client pr show hota hai )
// Reduce the amount of JavaScript sent to the browser.
// Improve the First Contentful Paint (FCP), and stream content progressively to the client.

//! 8. Dynamic Route Segments [slug] (only use in Server Component + Access by props.params)

//# A dynamic segment is created by wrapping a folder name in square brackets: [folderName]
//# For example, a blog route could look like: app/blog/[slug]/page.js
//# Here, [slug] is the dynamic segment representing the unique identifier for each blog post.

//# Use Case: When we need a single route with dynamic values â€” e.g. for user profiles,
//# where the route is the same (e.g. /profile/[id]) but the id changes based on the user.

//* Nested Dynamic Route Segment (e.g - app/(user)/users/[username]/post/[postId])- create inside Dynamic Route segment folder (e.g - app/(user)/users/[username])

//! 8.1 Catch-all Segments ( [...slug] for dynamic nested routes - it' part of Advance routing) (only use in Server Component + Access by props.params)

//# In Next.js catch-all segments [...slug] are incredibly useful when we want to handle "dynamic nested routes" without having to manually define each level of the path.

//^e.g 1> Blog with Nested Categories - Path eg:  /blog/technology/javascript
// Use Case - we may have blog categories and subcategories:
//            /blog     /blog/technology     /blog/technology/javascript

//* Instead of creating separate [category]/[subcategory]/page.jsx , we can use  app/blog/[...slug]/page.jsx
//* here [...slug] handle category inside multiple subcategory

//^e.g 2> E-commerce Product Catalog - Path e.g:  /shop/clothing/men/shirts
// Use Case - Users can filter or browser products through multiple nested categories.
// File:    app/shop/[...slug]/page.js

//! 8.2 Optional Catch-all Segments [[...slug]]  (only use in Server Component + Access by props.params)
//# Catch-all Segments can be made optional by including the parameter in double square brackets: [[...folderName]].

// For example, app/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js will also match /shop, in addition to /shop/clothes, /shop/clothes/tops, /shop/clothes/tops/t-shirts.

//? Diff. b/w Catch-All Segments and Optional Catch-All Segments -
//^ [...slug]  Catch-all segments
//  At least 1 slug required (e.g. /blog/a, /blog/a/b)
//  Does NOT match /blog   , if slug not present it's show 404 error
//  params.slug = ['a', 'b']

//^ [[...slug]]  Optional catch-all segments
//  0 or more slugs allowed (e.g. /blog, /blog/a, /blog/a/b)
//  Matches /blog also    ,   if slug not present default page show (like all posts) and deeper slugs to show details
//  params.slug = undefined | ['a'] | ['a', 'b']

//! 9. Dynamic or Nested Route Segments in Client Component - (using React 19 feature use api hook)  [Not Recommended]
//#  use Api hook - use is a React Api that read the value of a resource like a "Promise or context" .
// syntax-  const value = use(resource);
//? [Not Recommended] Dynamic or Nested Dynamic Route segments Always use in Server Component

//! 10. What is a "searchParams"? How To use URl Query String ? [In React Server Component]
//# In Next js (especially in App Router), searchParams is an optional prop we can access in server components or via loader functions "to read query parameters directly from the URL".
//# It's extremely useful for building features like Filtering, Sorting, Pagination, Search, Dynamic Deals  -- all of which are essential in e-commerce(ecom) websites.
//# searchParams is a Dynamic API whose values cannot be known ahead of time. Using it will opt the page into "dynamic rendering" at request time.

// it refers to the query string parameters in the URL - like this:
//             /products?category=shoes&sort=price_asc&page=2           (after ? mark all data is query string)

//^ (feature)             (Example URL)                       (what searchParams Enables)
//$ Filtering       /products?category=shoes&brand=nike       Filter product list by category and brand
//$ Sorting         /products?sort=price_asc                  Show result sorted by price, popularity, rating
//$ Pagination      /products?page=3                          Show next page of products
//$ Search          /products?query=red+jacket                Search product by keyword
//$ Dynamic Deals   /products?category=shoes&brand=nike       Show product with discounts over 30%

//! 11. Get Url Data (from Url path) or Handle Url Query String In Client Component In 2 way -

//? 11.1   Using "searchParams" with the help useApi React 19 hook in Client Component
//#  if React Client Component not page.jsx or it's component use inside server Component at that time we must pass prop.searchParams as a props otherwise it's shows undefined searchParams and throw error

//? 11.2   Using "useSearchParams hook"{next js hook/method/function} in Client Component   (Recommended way)
//# useSearchParams is a Client Component hook that lets we read the current URl's query string.

//! 12 Fetch API Data + Url Query String in Different way in Server Component vs Client Component -

//? 12.1 In React async Server Component - Fetch Api Data direct + if need to get urlQuery string then use props.searchParams
//? 12.2 In React Client Component - Fetch Api Data inside useEffect() + if need to get urlQuery string then (1st way)useSearchParams() hook / (2nd way) use(props.searchParams)

//! 13 loading.js/.jsx/.tsx file- (Automatic Loading show in next.js by using "loading.jsx" file(where Loading component define) inside App Folder)

//# When Content Not Serve / take time to load in UI / Fetch Data At that time we can show an instant loading state from the server while the content of a route segment streams in.
//# By default, this file is a Server Component - but we can also be used as a Client Component through the "use client" directive.

//? we can use same loading for all files {where loading.jsx file define in root folder} or Individual Ui loading for individual page.jsx folder {where individual loading.jsx file define inside that particular app folder name }
// todo_Note -  file name Must be small letter loading.js  and inside function component Name - Loading

// ! 14 <Suspense> fallback - [Part of page/UI loading... show in Server Component]
//# <Suspense> display fallback ui(loading.../loading animation) until it's children have finished loading or not get properly or take time
//# Suspense in Next.js : Load Async Part Only (wrap that component)- so Rest of UI Loads Immediately + fallback ui (together)
//@ Suspense only works for asynchronous child components of the current tree.
//@ But if the parent component itself throws or rejects (because the API call failed in the parent), then the entire tree cannot render, and React has no fallback to show
//@ fetch(...) runs before Suspense even comes into play.
//@ If fetch fails in parent(where suspense define) â†’ Parent cannot render â†’ Suspense never gets mounted â†’ hydration mismatch/error.

//^ For example-
//  Show a loading spinner for just part of the page
//  Fetch server-side data inside a component(server component)
//  Make our UI feel more responsive without waiting for everything

//? (Best Practice for Lazy loading or handle Async data)
//# In Server component - Use Suspense only when part of UI depends on slow server-side component data.(for Api call , Db queries, Rendering partial layout while data loads)
//todo Note- React.lazy() in server component not supported.

//# In Client component - Use when component is heavy or depends on client-only libraries(e.g charts, maps, modals etc)
//* 1st way> use React.lazy() + Suspense { Pure React style lazy loading} (Not Recommended)
//* 2nd way> next/dynamic()  {Preferred in Next.js , More flexible, Can enable/disable SSR , Works well with 3rd-party libs}

//! 15.1 Static Page Rendering [SSG] vs 15.2 Dynamic Page Rendering [SSR]  {In Server Component} -
//^ (In Console show)
// â—‹  (Static)   prerendered as static content
// Æ’  (Dynamic)  server-rendered on demand

//? Static Page (Default Behavior) / Pre-rendered once at build (SSG)
//# In Next.js, all routes page are 'static' by default.
//^ for e.g -
//$ Page is generated once during npm run build.
//$ Doesn't change based on user or request data.
//$ Loads super fast and can be cached by CDNs.

//* Note- Static Page Rendering - npm run build time that file show in console with this symbol "o" - that means "static (pre-rendered as static content)" , and after npm run build then npm run start- data which show first time in UI always fixed not change (even after database will change/update/delete that not reflect ) and store in cached {that called static site generation (SSG)/Pre-rendered once at build (SSG)}
//e.g [console show this]   o rendering/static

//? Dynamic Page Rendered on Every Request (SSR)
//# A page becomes dynamic when it depends on data that can change between requests, like:
//^ for e.g- (page where we use any of this become dynamic page)
//$ searchParams  (e.g- url query string-  /user?id=rock)
//$ header() function
//$ cookies() function
//$ useSearchParams() or usePathname()
//$ fetch() with cache : 'no-store' or next:{revalidate:0}
//$ Or when we manually mark a page (forcefully) as dynamic using (Route segment config):-     export const dynamic = "force-dynamic" ;
//* Note- Dynamic Page Rendering - npm run build time that file show in console with this symbol "f" - that means "Dynamic (server rendered on demand)" , and after npm run build then npm run start - data show in UI and constantly update on Every Request when (reload page), and automatically change based on database on Every Request (even after build, when database will change/update/delete that reflect) {that called server side rendering(SSR)}
//e.g [console show this]   Æ’ /rendering/dynamic

//! 15.3  Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)  [auto update/regenerate Static Pages without Rebuild after revalidation period]-
//# Update static content without rebuilding the entire site.
//# Reduce server load by serving pre-rendered, static page for most request.
//# Blend of both worlds: static generation + background revalidation.
//# On-demand revalidation: call res.revalidate('/page') in an API route to refresh specific pages

//* Note: To convert a static page to use ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration),
// add the following line inside the server component of the static page:

// export const revalidate = 60;

//^ This means (after build):
// - The cached data will be valid for 60 seconds (1 minute).
// - After that, the next request will trigger a background fetch to get fresh data.
// - During this fetch, stale data is still shown to the user.
// - Once regeneration completes, a page reload will show the updated data.
// - This helps serve pages faster (from cache) and reduces server load.

//e.g [console show this npm run build time]   o rendering/ISR       //^ that o means pre-rendered static content

//$ Summary Table -

//| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------  |

//$ Best Practices in Next.jsÂ 15 (For Server component) -
//? ðŸ”¹ Static Pages (SSG):
// - Use static rendering by default for speed and simplicity.
// - Best for pages with content that doesnâ€™t change often.
// - Example: Static Routes in the App Router. (e.g. /about) â€“ fast & simple

//? ðŸ”¹ Dynamic Pages (SSR):
// - Use Server-Side Rendering when you need real-time, user-specific, or authenticated data.
// - Example: Dynamic Routes with SSR. , Use for dynamic data like /dashboard or /profile â€“ real-time/authenticated.

//? ðŸ”¹ ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration):
// - Use ISR to keep static pages up-to-date without needing a full rebuild.
// - It combines the performance of static pages with the freshness of dynamic content.
// - Example:Use for static pages that need updates(ISR+SSG) (e.g. /blog) â€“ `export const revalidate = 60`..

//? ðŸ”¹ PPR (Partial Pre-Rendering) + Suspense:
// - Blend Combine static and dynamic rendering on the same page for better performance.
// - Use `Suspense` to load dynamic parts without blocking the static ones.
// - Great for improving performance while handling dynamic data.
// - Use for mixed content pages (e.g. /product/[id]) â€“ show static shell, load dynamic parts.

//! 16 React Cache() method - (Useful for Fast or Optimize data fetching in SSR-Server side Rendering(dynamic page) in Server Component)
//# cache() - it is a function introduced in React 18+ that allows to memoize (store the result of) a function based on its arguments so it's doesn't run again if called with same argument.
//# This is particularly useful on the server to avoid repeated data fetching for the same input, especially during SSR or RSC(React Server Component) rendering.
//# React cache() fetches data on first call and reuses it from memory for the same arguments on subsequent server calls.
//* Note- cache() works only in server components or in server environment like Next.js app router.

// import { cache } from 'react'
// export const getItem = cache(async id => { /* DB/API fetch */ })

//todo-  Bonus: Ye automatic cache invalidation nahi karta, toh manual handling zaroori ho sakti hai jab data dynamic ho.(old way)
//todo-  New way: Next js 15 introduce 'use cache'

//! 17. not-found.js / not-found.jsx file (it's Server Component) : it Fix Next default Route Error and Show Error page UI-
//# not-found.jsx component is use for show Error Page  , and it's automatic appear when hit wrong path in url

//^(Inside we get this functionality) like this-
//? Go Back Home button-  we use Link component. e.g <Link href="/"> ... </Link>

//? Go Previous Page button - we use useRouter() method from next/navigation , but it's work only in client component .
//   const router = useRouter()   ,                   {for app router get from next/navigation}
//    router.back();          // Goes to previous page
//    router.push("/");       // Fallback to home page

//! notFound() -
//? notFound() fun. call - When In fetching time / Database data not get - next js not show byDefault not-found.jsx page , but we get using call of notFound() function then not-Found.jsx page show in UI.

//! 18. generateStaticParams()  -
//# the generateStaticParams function can be "used in combination with dynamic route segment to statically generate routes at build time" instead of on-demand at request time.
// export async function generateStaticParams() {}                // used inside dynamic route page
//^ UseCase - when database data fetch using params (for getting dynamic route value (id)) (so it's default dynamic page rendering b/c use of param) so prevent every time send req. to database for get data , we use generateStaticParams() function which map all dynamic id , so build time all data store in memory based on the id , (after npm run start) so now data show fastly when send req. in url as a statically generate

//$ keynotes-
//# generateStaticParams() only work in Server Component.
//# if we have big dataset (means 1 million+ slugs(dynamic value)) then build time error show. then hybrid dynamic/ISR is better.
//# use when dynamic routes[slug],[id](dynamic render page) to pre-render static page , so In short Dynamic pages ko build time pr static pages m convert karne k liye ye fun use hota hai

//! 19. Server Action + "use server" :- {use when In server component Insert Form data into MySql, Server Action is for server logic, and "use server" tells Next.js to keep it on the server only}

//? Server Actions - Server Actions are async functions that run only on the server and are used to handle form submissions, mutate data, or perform secure logic without needing an API route.

//^ Use Case:
// Form submission without useState, onSubmit, etc.
// Directly call a function on the server when a form is submitted.
// Avoid client-side JavaScript for simple forms.

//? "use server" -  "use server" is a special directive used inside a server action function to tell Next.js: "This async function must always run on the server."

//^ Use Case:
// Mandatory when we define a server action in the same file as a client or shared module.
// It tells the bundler to not include this function in client bundles.

//*e.g-
//    "use server";                                                // it could define inside fun. or at the top
//    export async function contactServerAction(formData) {             // define Server Action (async fun.)
//          server-side logic (e.g., save to DB)
//      }

//!  20. Using native <form> tag with React Server Actions and new React 19 hooks {For Client Component}
//^ Best when:
//  we need real data mutations (POST, file uploads, etc.)
// Want built-in loading/error states via React19 hooks like useActionState, useFormStatus, useOptimistic

//^ Pros:
// Full Post support (validated, secure server calls)
// Automatically tracks pending/error state
// No need for separate API routes

//^ Cons:
// Requires client component ('use client')
// Tied to React 19 / Next.js 15 Server Actions

//$ useActionState() -   useActionState is a Hook that allows to upload update state based on the result of a form action.
//  const [state, formAction, isPending] = useActionState(fn, initialState, permallink?);
//^ here  state - after form submit fun return data store here (e.g.like data submit or error) , formAction - it used to tell component trigger useActionState hook , isPending - handle pending state automatically and return true and false value , fn - server action(server fun.) , initialState - null (form submit initial value)

//$ useFormStatus() - useFromStatus Hook [React Dom v19 hook] provides status information of the last form submission like (pending, data, method, action information which we can destructure).
//#  provides status info from a parent <form> using Form Actions.
//# we can read:
// pending: whether the form submission is in process
// data, method, action (Reactâ€¯19+ only)
// It tracks the formâ€™s state via React Context instead of prop drilling .

//^  Use only inside a child component of a <form action={...}>.
//   const status = useFormStatus()         or
//   const {pending, data, method, action  } = useFormStatus();

//^ In Short- useFormStatus React hook returns a status object with pending (true if form is submitting), data (submitted FormData or null), method ('get' or 'post'), and action (form action function or null), useful only inside a client component within a <form> using Form Actions.

//! 21. redirect() : {Next js method in Server Component which use to redirect the user to another Url}
//# the redirect fun. allows to redirect the user to another Url.
//# it can be used in "Server components, Route Handlers and Server Actions".
//^ useCase - we can use in contact form or login form when submit or successful login , we can redirect the user to another url (page- like home page) . [Only Work in Server Component (SSR), Server Action , Route handlers]
// import { redirect } from "next/navigation";
// redirect("/")
// todo-  In Server Action and Route Handlers , redirect should be called outside the try block when try/catch statements , otherwise it's throws an error.
//@ but we can handle error with this code -    if (error.message === "NEXT_REDIRECT") throw error;

//! 22. useRouter() hook : In Client component , we use this hook for redirect the user to another url(page) after form submit/login successfully
//# the useRouter hook allows to programmatically change routes inside Client component.
//* Recommendation : use the <link> component to navigation unless we have a specific requirement for using useRouter.
//^ e.g-  import {useRouter} from "next/navigation";
//^         const router = useRouter ()
//* then we use any of this -
//$ router.push(href) - Page switch karta hai, history mein nayi entry.   [ here we use this e.g ]
//$ router.replace(href) - Page switch karta hai, par history mein nayi entry nahi.
//$ router.refresh() - Page ko refresh karta hai bina client-side state lose kiye.
//$ router.prefetch(href) - Page ko pehle se load kar leta hai, taaki jaldi load ho.
//$ router.back() - Pichle page pe jata hai.
//$ router.forward() - Agle page pe jata hai.

//! 23. useTransition() Hook â€“ [React 19 + Next.js 15]
// useTransition is a React Hook that lets render a part of the UI in the background which takes time , so user interaction not slow.
// # Marks some updates as "low priority" so UI stays smooth during heavy or async tasks.
// # Returns: [isPending, startTransition]
//     - isPending: true while transition is happening (show loader, etc.)
//     - startTransition(fn): Runs update in background (non-blocking)
//^ React 19 Feature:
//     - Now supports async functions inside startTransition()
//     - Helpful for API calls, form submissions, optimistic UI, loading/error handling
//^  Next.js 15 Integration:
//     - Works perfectly with <form action={serverAction}>
//     - Keeps UI responsive during server mutations or route actions
//^  Use it when:
//     - Filtering/searching big lists
//     - Rendering charts, tabs, lazy components
//     - Submitting forms to server
//     - Updating UI with optimistic feedback
//^  Don't use for:
//     - Small state changes (like toggle, counter)
//     - Simple input updates (e.g., typing in a text field without side effects)
// todo -{Not Recommended useTransition in Next js for form  - we can use useActionState for contact Form}

//! 24. revalidatePath() - {Cache Invalidation on Demand}
//#  revalidatePath allows you to purge (remove) cached data for a specific route/path
//#  revalidatePath(): Cache ko stale mark karta hai (fresh fetch next visit par hota hai)
//todo-  Use Case: Jab bhi data update ho (form submit, CMS change), to fresh data ensure karne ke liye

//$  Sirf Server Actions ya API Routes ke andar use hota hai (client-side se nahi)
//*  Static path: revalidatePath('/blog/post-1')
//*  Dynamic path: revalidatePath('/blog/[slug]', 'page')  // 2nd arg 'page' ya 'layout' dena zaroori hai

//^  Ye data turant fetch nahi karta, sirf cache invalidate karta hai.
//^  Abhi ye pura client-side router cache bhi clear kar deta hai (future mein path-specific hoga)
//^  full control chahiye to revalidateTag() use karo (multiple pages ya shared data ke liye)

//todo- But here Server Component + Server Action ka use kar rahe ho. Jab form submit karte ho:
//todo- Server Action revalidatePath call karta hai.
//todo- Is se server-side cache + client-side Router cache dono clear ho jate hain.
//todo- Is wajah se UI turant refresh ho jata hai â€” bina manually page reload kiye.

//!25  Client Component form + Server Action revalidate data using router.refresh() method {which part of useRouter hook next/navigation}
//? router.refresh() -It forces the current route to re-render â€” including all server components â€” and fetches fresh data.
//^ here e.g
//Step-1 Form submit hua client component me.
//Step-2 hospitalServerAction(data) call hua â€” DB me data gaya.
//Step-3 router.refresh() run hua.
//Step-4 Browser reload jaisa effect deta hai, lekin bina full page reload ke.
//Step- Agar kisi page me server components hain jo database se data fetch karte hain, to unka data dobara fetch hota hai.
//Step- Current page re-render hua â€” including server component HospitalFormWithRecord.
//Step- Server component ne DB se naya data fetch kiya.
//Step- UI me naya record turant show ho gaya â€” bina page reload ke.

//#  In short for here e.g - router.refresh() ka kaam tha server component ko dobara run karwana taaki updated DB data turant UI me dikh sake â€” bina manually page reload kiye.
